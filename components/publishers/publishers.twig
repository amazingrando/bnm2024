		<h2>About the Bits and Mortar Program</h2>
		<p>The Bits and Mortar program benefits publishers by providing customers with more value when they purchase your books in physical stores. We help ensure that when you offer a print-and-PDF bundle that everyone can take advantage of that deal.</p>
		<p>We’ll want you to buy into
			<a href="https://www.bits-and-mortar.com/about-bits-and-mortar">our philosophy and our approach</a>
			— trusting brick and mortar retail stores to give out your PDFs and giving out those PDFs free of charge with the purchase of the corresponding physical book.</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Signing up is entirely free.</strong>
			When you take advantage of this program you are never locked in—you can still give away or sell ebooks however you like.</p>
